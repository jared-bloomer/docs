# Implementation Plan for Implement Bootstrap Styling

## Milestone 1: Integrate Bootstrap Framework
- **Description**: Add Bootstrap to the project by including the Bootstrap CDN in the HTML file.
- **Expected Outcome**: Bootstrap styles are available for use throughout the site.

## Milestone 2: Apply Bootstrap Layout and Components
- **Description**: Refactor the homepage layout and elements to use Bootstrap's grid system, containers, and components for improved responsiveness and structure.
- **Expected Outcome**: The site layout and elements use Bootstrap classes and are visually improved.

## Milestone 3: Implement Dark/Light Mode (Dark Default)
- **Description**: Enable Bootstrap's dark and light mode support, with dark mode as the default. Add a toggle for users to switch between modes.
- **Expected Outcome**: The site loads in dark mode by default, and users can switch to light mode.

## Milestone 4: Enhance General Site Styling
- **Description**: Use Bootstrap utilities and components to further style navigation, buttons, sections, and other UI elements for a polished look.
- **Expected Outcome**: The site has a cohesive, modern appearance using Bootstrap styling.

## Milestone 5: Test and Document
- **Description**: Test the site for responsiveness, accessibility, and correct dark/light mode behavior. Document the Bootstrap integration and styling approach.
- **Expected Outcome**: The site works as intended across devices and modes, and documentation is updated.

**Note**: Each milestone is a discrete, testable change. Complex tasks are broken into smaller, manageable steps for clarity and verification.
