# Implementation Plan: Add Wiki Dropdown Menu

This plan outlines the high-level steps required to implement the Wiki dropdown menu feature for the GitHub Pages site. Each milestone is a single, discrete, and testable change.

## Milestone 1: Update Navigation to Use Bootstrap Dropdown
- Update the site navigation to use Bootstrap's dropdown menu component for the new 'Wiki' menu item.
- Expected Outcome: The navigation bar displays a 'Wiki' dropdown menu styled with Bootstrap, but with no links yet.

## Milestone 2: Add 'Copilot' Section to Wiki Dropdown
- Add a 'Copilot' section as the first item in the Wiki dropdown menu.
- Expected Outcome: The Wiki dropdown contains a 'Copilot' link that leads to a dedicated wiki page for Copilot information.

## Milestone 3: Create Initial Copilot Wiki Page
- Create a new HTML page for the Copilot section of the wiki, following the site's documentation organization standards.
- Expected Outcome: The Copilot wiki page exists and is accessible from the dropdown, ready for content to be added (but no public/copied documentation included).

## Milestone 4: Ensure Documentation Organization and Navigation
- Review and adjust the navigation and documentation structure to ensure clarity, organization, and ease of navigation for future wiki sections.
- Expected Outcome: The navigation and documentation structure is clear, organized, and ready for additional wiki sections in the future.
