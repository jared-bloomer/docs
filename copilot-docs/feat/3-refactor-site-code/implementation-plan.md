# Implementation Plan: Refactor Site Code

This document outlines the high-level milestones for refactoring the GitHub Pages site to use Bootstrap and a modular file structure. Each milestone is a discrete, testable change.

## Milestone 1: Establish Modular File Structure
- Expected Outcome: The site directory is reorganized to separate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets. The existing `index.html` is moved to a new structure without functional changes.

## Milestone 2: Create `base.html` Template
- Expected Outcome: A `base.html` file is created to serve as the template for all site pages, containing shared layout and Bootstrap includes.

## Milestone 3: Refactor `index.html` to Extend `base.html`
- Expected Outcome: The main page content is moved into a new file that extends `base.html`, removing duplicated layout code.

## Milestone 4: Create Additional Page Files
- Expected Outcome: Additional HTML files are created for each logical page, each extending `base.html` and containing only page-specific content.

## Milestone 5: Update Asset References and Test Site
- Expected Outcome: All asset references (CSS, JS, images) are updated to match the new structure. The site is tested to ensure all pages render correctly and Bootstrap styling is applied.

## Milestone 6: Documentation and Lessons Learned
- Expected Outcome: Documentation is updated to reflect the new structure, and any lessons learned are added to `lessons-learned.md`.
