      <p>Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by GitHub that helps developers write code faster and more efficiently by providing real-time code suggestions, autocompletions, and context-aware recommendations directly within the code editor. It leverages advanced machine learning models trained on a vast range of public code to offer relevant snippets, function completions, and even entire algorithms, streamlining the development process and reducing repetitive coding tasks.

      <p>Now let's get real. Copilot is a tool that helps write code for you. Think of it as a mid-level developer that can write code 1000x faster than you. Is it good, not really. Does it need to iterate over the code it writes and make several changes, ABSOLUTELY. Just like a human, it rarely will get it right on the first try. It will have to iterate over the changes and make revisions to get to the final solution.</p>

      <p>If copilot can do that, then what do I do? Great Question. Your role in this is to pair with copilot. Your job is no longer to write the code, but to tell copilot what you want it to do, provide context, and the fact-check it's work.</p>
